I made this as a project for fun, mainly to see/have an insight at commandline habbits. This project is entirely made in python, hence easy to modify depending on anyones preferences.

Main feature include
 - Allowing to see command history in tabular form from all shells(bash/zsh/fish)
 - extensive elaboration on commandline habbits 
 - Allowing one to track most used commands with style (Gruvbox theme)


Dependencies you might need
  - python, pip, tabulate (pip install tabulate, python-tabulate on aur)


Future plan
  - Adding graphs
  - More themes maybe
  - Gui? maybe


Plase feel free to fork this simple proj and adding your twists :)
